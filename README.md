# Factory Design Pattern
This repo is a practive repository after studying more about the Factory Method. Unit tests are included in the repository.

### When Should The Abstract Factory Method Be Used?
* An object's class doesn't know what exact sub-classes it has to create

* An object should be configured by on of several possible families of linked objects that will be part of your parent object

### How To Run Unit Tests From CLI
* Install Composer

```
composer install
```

* Execute PHPUnit

```
vendor/bin/phpunit
```
